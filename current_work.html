      Optimize Tensor-Core-Based Gaussian Splatting CUDA Kernel
    </h2>
    <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
      I've done some background study of NeRFs and their method for view synthesis.
      I've so far finsihed understanding these papers - <a href="https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/3d_gaussian_splatting_low.pdf" style="color: blue; font-style: italic;">3DGS</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24796" style="color: blue; font-style: italic;">TC-GS</a>, including maths involved and It's actually not that complex as it feels like.<br> I'm currently trying to run Tensor Core Implementation and trying to profile individual kernel performances required in the entire pipeline.
      My goal is spot some key bottlenecks in this pipeline and try to optimise the corresponding kernels.

      ForkAndMove : Chess Engine with Parallel Aplha-Beta Algorithm <a class="text-black-700" href="https://github.com/meetbanthia/ForkAndMove">[Code]</a>
    </h2>

    <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Bitwise operators are crazy!<br>
      I'm building my own chess engine from scratch. It's a fun project which uses bitmaps for efficient coomputation of chess moves and board evaluation using just bitwise operators.
      I've began to realise it is not as easy as I thought it would be. Rules like en-passant and castling makes it a bit complicated. <br>I've so far implemented bitmaps implementation of board representation, board evaluation, move generators. My next goal is to write an efficient parallel implementation of widely used aplha-beta search algorithm. I have not found any OpenMP based effcient implementation of this as this algorithm is inherently sequential. 
      <br>I've got few ideas to proceed with like use of beam search, parallely computing nodes upto certain plie then check values of aplha and beta and maybe resume computation.
      <br>I'm implementing in <a href="https://github.com/MPLLang/mpl" style="color: blue;">MaPLe</a>, a Standard ML based functional language for provably efficient and safe multicore parallelism.
